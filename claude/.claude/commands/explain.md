description: Explain how code works in plain language
---

Explain the specified code, file, or function. Structure your explanation as:

1. **Purpose**: What does this code do? (1-2 sentences)
2. **How It Works**: Step-by-step walkthrough of the logic
3. **Key Concepts**: Any patterns, algorithms, or techniques used
4. **Dependencies**: What this code relies on (imports, external services)
5. **Usage**: How to call/use this code with examples

Adjust depth based on complexity:
- Simple utility functions: Brief explanation
- Complex algorithms: Detailed walkthrough with diagrams if helpful
- Architecture/system code: Include context about how it fits in the larger system

Use code snippets to illustrate key points. Avoid jargon unless explaining it.
